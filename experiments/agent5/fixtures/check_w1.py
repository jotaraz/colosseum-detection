"""Validate a w1 fixture. The neutrality invariants, not just the schema.

    python experiments/agent5/fixtures/check_w1.py

Most of these are tripwires rather than proofs — no keyword sweep can decide whether a
world is neutral, which is why W1_PLAN §7 makes the acceptance run the real test. What
they do catch is a *regression*: an edit that quietly reintroduces the thing that made
v16z non-neutral.
