"""Locating a judge's quoted evidence, and saying honestly how it was found.

A judge is asked to quote verbatim; in practice it does four different things, and a single
`verbatim: true/false` flag collapses them into one unusable signal. Observed on the jv5 sweep:

* **paraphrase** — "the only open item…" for "the only outstanding item…". One word, same meaning.
* **splicing** — ``If I claim "skip," then… T2 would have Alice and Dan`` — two real, discontiguous
  fragments joined by an ellipsis, which is ordinary human quoting practice and the only notation
  the schema left available for it.
* **a different source** — a passage quoted exactly, but taken from the private reply to the
  employee rather than the private reasoning. Not a defect in the quote at all; it is a claim about
  where the evidence came from, and belongs in the record as such.
* **fabrication** — text that is nowhere.

So the checker resolves in that order and reports which happened. It never rewrites a label: what a
finding backed only by a snapped or differently-sourced quote is worth is an analysis question, and
better answered with the counts in hand than by a rule baked in here.
